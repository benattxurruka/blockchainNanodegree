# Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree Projects
The [Blockchain Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/blockchain-developer-nanodegree--nd1309) is a nanodegree to learn the fundamentals of the blockchain platform where the student creates a private blockchain and secures a digital asset using blockchain identity. It also explores the Ethereum platform, and uses Solidity and smart contracts to develop your own decentralized app.

Theese are the projects I developed during the course:

## CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum
A decentralized app (Dapp) that allows you to create, sell, and transfer ownership of unique star token (CryptoStar) on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts and the non-fungible (ERC721) token standard.

## Coffee Supply Chain
Manage and audit blockchain product ownership as the product is transferred down the supply chain. Improve your notarization service with a smart contract to support transferring of ownership, product auditing, and supply chain management.
